/**
 * TimeManager
 *
 * The Chronos Switch runtime. Owns the current era (`Present` | `Past`),
 * flips the active camera's layerMask to toggle visibility between them,
 * and records changes made while in the Past so the Present can read them
 * later — the intergenerational-consequence mechanic.
 *
 * See:
 *   - `docs/design-docs/TIMELINE_SYNC.md` — design and flag convention.
 *   - `docs/design-docs/CHRONOS_SWITCH.md` — overall mechanic.
 *   - `ARCHITECTURE.md §4` — layer-mask strategy.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Exactly one era is active at any time.
 *   - Transition is single-flight — overlapping calls are rejected.
 *   - Changes recorded via `recordPastChange(key)` set the flag
 *     `PAST_FLAG_PREFIX + key` in `globalState` and are readable
 *     from either era via `hasPastChange(key)`.
 *   - TimeManager never mutates world geometry directly; scenes
 *     subscribe to era-change events and react.
